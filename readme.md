# ☁️ Serverless Image Resizer

A fully serverless AWS application that allows users to upload images through a modern web interface. Images are securely uploaded to Amazon S3 using Presigned URLs, automatically resized by AWS Lambda, and stored in a separate S3 bucket for download.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an event-driven, serverless architecture using AWS services. Instead of uploading files through a traditional backend server, the frontend requests a secure Presigned URL from AWS Lambda via API Gateway. The browser uploads the image directly to Amazon S3, which triggers another Lambda function to resize the image using the Pillow library.

The processed image is stored in a separate S3 bucket and can then be viewed or downloaded.

# ⚙️ How It Works

### Step 1

The user selects an image from the web application.

↓

### Step 2

The frontend requests a Presigned Upload URL from API Gateway.

↓

### Step 3

API Gateway invokes the **GenerateUploadURL Lambda**.

↓

### Step 4

Lambda returns a secure Presigned URL.

↓

### Step 5

The browser uploads the image directly to Amazon S3.

↓

### Step 6

Amazon S3 automatically triggers the **ImageResizer Lambda**.

↓

### Step 7

The Lambda function resizes and optimizes the uploaded image using Pillow.

↓

### Step 8

The resized image is stored in a separate S3 bucket and becomes available for viewing or downloading.
